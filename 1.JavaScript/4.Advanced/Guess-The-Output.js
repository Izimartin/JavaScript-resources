  // 👍A) 2     💡B) 3
  // 💖C) 4     😀D) 5

  /*
  Answer is B) 3 because arguments keyword is an array of arguments passed to the function. 
  Here while calling object.method(), we are passing three arguments callback fn(), 2 and 3.
  If we try to console arguments it will look like this 👇

  Arguments(3) [ƒ, 2, 3, callee: ƒ, Symbol(Symbol.iterator): ƒ]
  0: ƒ callback()
  1: 2
  2: 3
  callee: ƒ ()
  length: 3
  Symbol(Symbol.iterator): ƒ values()
  [[Prototype]]: Object

  As we can clearly see, arguments is having length property that is equal to number of arguments passed to function.
  So, arguments[0] is nothing but the first argument passed to function that is callback function in this case.
  As we know, Everything in JavaScript is an object ( arguments is also an object which has length property with value 3 )
  arguments[0]() function's "this" will refer to arguments object. Hence, It will console 3 as an output.
