# Distributed Systems with Node.js: Companion Files

These are the companion files for Distributed Systems with Node.js, O'Reilly 2020. These files aren't required to follow along with the book; the book contains everything you need to recreate them. However, they're provided here as a convenience.

If you can't get a program to run you may find that by looking at these files you've made a typo. Or, you may find that one day an npm package update causes an incompatibility in your program, at which point a _package-lock.json_ file in here may help you out.

## Breaking Errata

- CH4 SEC1: When running the ELK stack Docker container on macOS, you'll need to [increase the maximum memory in Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#resources) to at least 4GB. If you don't then you might find that the container doesn't start correctly.
